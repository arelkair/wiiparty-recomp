## Summary

Every minigame in every Free Play list (4 players, 1 vs 3, 1 vs 1 and pairs) has been played by hand: 79 entries, 71 without faults. Open faults: graphics in ¡Puños fuera!, Carrera galáctica, Saltos selváticos and Bote a bote; Mii faces in ¡Canastas! and Las puertas del pánico; input in Bebés llorones; Fotos perrunas to check.

## Other observations

- Moving the game window feels laggy.

- Some menu sounds may not match the original: in the Free Play 4-player minigame list, the + and - buttons (scrolling) seem to play the same click as many other buttons (such as Start), while the user believes they should sound different. Reported again on 2026-09-28. Not yet compared with Dolphin.
- Mii faces: the user's Mii shows lips it does not have, in the HUD icons of ¡Canastas! and in game in Las puertas del pánico; Saltos selváticos and Bote a bote also change faces. Probably one shared fault in how Mii face parts (mouth, eyes, eyebrows) are chosen or drawn. Some female guest Miis look masculine. Abby, described by Mii wikis as blonde with blue eyes and slim eyebrows, showed brown hair and marked eyebrows in the Mii selection. Not yet compared with Dolphin.
- The cursor leaves a trail, also in menus. Whether the game draws it is not yet known.
