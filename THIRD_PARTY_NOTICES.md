## Ingested Third-Party Components (GPL-2.0-or-later)

All components adapted from the **Dolphin Emulator** originate from a source snapshot of **version 2606** (stored locally under the untracked path `reference/dolphin-source/`). 

### 1. GX Lighting Pipeline
- **Repository Files:** `engine/src/gpu/gx_lighting.cpp` | `engine/include/wp/gx_lighting.h`.
- **Upstream Origin:** `Source/Core/VideoBackends/Software/TransformUnit.cpp` (Register mapping references `VideoCommon/XFMemory.h`).
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2009 Dolphin Emulator Project.
- **License Compliance:** `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later` (Fully compatible with GPL-3.0-or-later).
- **Engineering Changes (2026-09-22):** 
  - Rewritten to read from this project's flat XF register array instead of packed structs.
  - Shifted internal operations to standalone RGBA bytes instead of ABGR layouts.
  - Stripped out upstream panic alert handlers and fixed divide-by-zero edge cases on null normal lengths.

### 2. Emulated Bluetooth Controller
- **Repository Files:** `engine/src/input/bluetooth.cpp` | `engine/include/wp/bluetooth.h`.
- **Upstream Origin:** `Source/Core/Core/IOS/USB/Bluetooth/BTEmu.cpp`, `IOS/USB/USBV0.cpp` (USB V0 layout), and `BTBase.h` (buffer constants).
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2008 Dolphin Emulator Project.
- **License Compliance:** `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`.
- **IP Isolation Note:** Downstream files `hci.h` and `l2cap.h` were **not** copied due to licensing mixtures (FreeBSD/NetBSD BSD-licensed code). All HCI opcodes and event structures were clean-room written from the official Bluetooth specification.
- **Engineering Changes (2026-09-23):** 
  - Adapted connection mechanics and L2CAP signaling from `WiimoteDevice.cpp`.
  - Refactored around this runtime's asynchronous IOS request architecture (`ios::take_completion`).
  - Replaced packed structs with native byte vectors and eliminated save-state overhead.

### 3. Emulated Wii Remote State Machine
- **Repository Files:** `engine/src/input/wiimote.cpp` | `engine/include/wp/wiimote.h`.
- **Upstream Origin:** `Source/Core/Core/HW/WiimoteEmu/EmuSubroutines.cpp`, `WiimoteEmu.cpp`, and `Camera.cpp`.
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2010/2019 Dolphin Emulator Project.
- **License Compliance:** `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`.
- **IP Isolation Note:** Upstream motion simulation (`Dynamics.cpp`), extensions, MotionPlus and cryptography layers were completely omitted.
- **Engineering Changes (2026-09-23):** 
  - Implemented a clean-room custom mapping math from PC pointer to dual IR coordinates, calibrated directly against native KPAD reports.
  - Linked reporting events back into the Bluetooth interface via lightweight callbacks.
  - Added the speaker stream decoder (2026-10-10) after `Source/Core/Core/HW/WiimoteEmu/Speaker.cpp`: 4-bit Yamaha ADPCM (two 16-entry lookup tables and the predictor/step update, which upstream marks as based on the ffmpeg project's decoder, copyright 2001-2003 its authors) and signed 8-bit PCM, with the register layout, sample-rate formula and volume scaling of the upstream file. Output goes to this project's own mixer (`engine/src/audio/audio.cpp`).

### 4. DSP Hardware Core & Free Interpreter ROMs
- **Repository Files:** Full tree under `third_party/dolphin/` (Maintains upstream structural isolation).
- **Upstream Origin:** `Source/Core/Core/DSP/` core infrastructure, interpreter modules, and standalone data blobs.
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2004-2018 Dolphin Emulator Project / Duddie & Tratax.
- **License Compliance:** `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`.
- **Ingested Assets:** Includes `dsp_rom.bin` and `dsp_coef.bin` (Version 0.4 free alternative ROMs created by Dolphin contributors). Embedded as clean native C++ resources into `games/wiiparty/res/wiiparty.rc`. Contains zero Nintendo code.
- **Engineering Changes:** 
  - Completely purged the upstream DSP JIT engine; forced exclusive lockstep execution of the interpreter directly on the main CPU thread.
  - Patched signed integer overflows (undefined behavior at `-O2` optimization flags) in `GetMultiplyProduct` inside `DSPInterpreter.cpp`.
  - Bound compilation dependencies through a dedicated local shim layer (`third_party/dolphin_shim/`), preventing external library leakage.

### 5. Gekko Floating-Point Estimates and Single-Precision Rounding
- **Repository Files:** `engine/include/wp/cpu.h` (`reciprocal_estimate`, `reciprocal_sqrt_estimate`, `force25`, `madd_single` and their tables).
- **Upstream Origin:** `Source/Core/Common/FloatUtils.cpp` (`ApproximateReciprocal`, `ApproximateReciprocalSquareRoot`, `fres_expected`, `frsqrte_expected`) and `Source/Core/Core/PowerPC/Interpreter/Interpreter_FPUtils.h` (`Force25Bit`, the single-precision branch of `NI_madd_msub`), current master as of 2026-09-29.
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2018 Dolphin Emulator Project.
- **License Compliance:** `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`.
- **Engineering Changes (2026-09-29):** Rewritten as inline functions over `wp::fpr_bits`; FPSCR exception flags and the flush-to-zero option are not modelled; the estimate tables are unchanged.

### 6. Wii Remote Pairing on Windows
- **Repository Files:** `launcher/src/wiimote_pairing.cpp` | `launcher/src/wiimote_pairing.h`.
- **Upstream Origin:** `Source/Core/Core/HW/WiimoteReal/IOWin.cpp` (`AuthenticateWiimote`, `RemoveUnusableWiimoteBluetoothDevices`, `DiscoverAndPairWiimotes`, `FindAndAuthenticateWiimotes`), version 2606 snapshot.
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2008 Dolphin Emulator Project.
- **License Compliance:** `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`.
- **Engineering Changes (2026-09-29):** Rewritten as two plain functions over the Windows Bluetooth API: the host address as the SYNC-button pass key, three inquiry rounds, removal of remembered but unauthenticated remotes and enabling the HID service; logging and the 1+2 method were dropped.

### 7. EXI Bus, IPL Device and SRAM
- **Repository Files:** `engine/src/core/exi.cpp` | `engine/include/wp/exi.h`.
- **Upstream Origin:** `Source/Core/Core/HW/EXI/EXI_Channel.cpp`, `Source/Core/Core/HW/EXI/EXI_DeviceIPL.cpp` and `Source/Core/Core/HW/Sram.cpp`, current master as of 2026-09-30.
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2008 Dolphin Emulator Project.
- **License Compliance:** `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`.
- **Engineering Changes (2026-09-30):** Rewritten as a single file for 32-bit register access: three channels with immediate and DMA transfers, only the IPL device (SRAM, real-time clock, UART and the Wii RTC flags); no memory cards, BBA or other devices; SRAM is kept in `sram.bin` beside the NAND folder.

### 8. Serial Interface (SI)
- **Repository Files:** `engine/src/input/si.cpp` | `engine/include/wp/si.h`.
- **Upstream Origin:** `Source/Core/Core/HW/SI/SI.cpp`, current master as of 2026-09-30.
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2008 Dolphin Emulator Project.
- **License Compliance:** `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`.
- **Engineering Changes (2026-09-30):** Register layout and status bits kept; transfers complete at once with no device on any port; no GameCube controller, GBA or keyboard devices.

### 9. Hollywood GPIO Registers
- **Repository Files:** `engine/src/core/hollywood.cpp` | `engine/include/wp/hollywood.h`.
- **Upstream Origin:** `Source/Core/Core/HW/WII_IPC.cpp` and `Source/Core/Core/HW/WII_IPC.h` (the GPIO pin layout, the pins the PowerPC may access, the direction register reset value, the disc-slot input and the three constant registers), current master as of 2026-10-06.
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2008 Dolphin Emulator Project.
- **License Compliance:** `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`.
- **Engineering Changes (2026-10-06):** Rewritten as a small module over three 32-bit registers (`0xCD8000C0` output, `0xCD8000C4` direction, `0xCD8000C8` input) and the constants at `0xCD800180`, `0xCD8001CC` and `0xCD8001D0`; the disc is always inside, there is no eject, sensor bar or video encoder behaviour.

## Externally Linked Libraries (Permissive Licenses)

These dependencies are dynamically linked during runtime or retrieved through automated build scripts; no code is hosted directly inside the repository.

### SDL3 Development Package
- **Usage Area:** Hardware gamepad mappings (Sticks, gyroscope, accelerometer processing) inside `engine/src/input/gamepad.cpp`; outside Windows also the window, OpenGL context, keyboard, mouse, audio output and PNG loading (`video_sdl.cpp`, `gx_render_gl.cpp`, `audio.cpp`, `custom_textures.cpp`), linked to the SDL3 installed on the system.
- **Version:** 3.4.16 (Retrieved by `tools/fetch_sdl.py` into build tree).
- **License:** **zlib License** (Fully compatible with GPL-3.0-or-later).
- **Copyright:** Copyright (C) 1997-2026 Sam Lantinga.

### Launcher Libraries (`launcher/`)
The launcher is a single static executable. CMake downloads each library below at configure time and checks its published SHA-256; none of them is stored in this repository. The launcher's Licenses page shows every license text.
- **SDL 3.4.16:** window, input, file dialogs and rendering, linked statically. **zlib License**. Copyright (C) 1997-2026 Sam Lantinga.
- **Dear ImGui 1.92.9b:** user interface. **MIT License**. Copyright (c) 2014-2026 Omar Cornut.
- **Inter 4.1 (Regular and SemiBold):** embedded font. **SIL Open Font License 1.1**. Copyright (c) 2016 The Inter Project Authors.
- **mingw-w64 winpthreads:** threading runtime of the MinGW-w64 GCC toolchain, linked statically. **MIT-style license** (`launcher/licenses/winpthreads.txt`). Copyright (c) 2011 mingw-w64 project.
- **GCC runtime libraries (libstdc++, libgcc):** linked statically. **GPL-3.0 with the GCC Runtime Library Exception 3.1** (`launcher/licenses/gcc-runtime-library-exception.txt`).

### Linux AppImage (release asset `wiipartyrecomp-launcher-x86_64.AppImage`)
Built by `tools/make_appimage.py`; nothing of it is stored in this repository. It holds the Linux launcher (the libraries above, with libstdc++ and libgcc linked statically; glibc stays the system's), the project icon and a desktop entry, packed by:
- **appimagetool 1.9.1** (https://github.com/AppImage/appimagetool, SHA-256 checked): build tool only, not included in the file. **MIT License**.
- **AppImage type2-runtime 20251108** (https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime, SHA-256 checked): the small program at the start of the file that mounts it. **MIT License**. It is built on Alpine Linux 3.21 and statically linked with **libfuse 3.15.0** (**LGPL-2.1**, with the runtime's patch to `mount.c`), **squashfuse 0.5.2** (**BSD 2-Clause**), **zstd** (**BSD 3-Clause**), **zlib** (**zlib License**), **mimalloc** (**MIT**) and **musl libc** (**MIT**).
- **Corresponding source:** the release file `wiipartyrecomp-sources.zip` also carries the unmodified source releases of type2-runtime 20251108 (with its build scripts and the libfuse patch) and libfuse 3.15.0. `--appimage-extract` unpacks the launcher as a plain file, so the runtime can be replaced.

### Offline Tools Pack (release asset `wiipartyrecomp-offline-windows.zip`)
Built by `tools/make_offline_pack.py`; nothing of it is stored in this repository. It redistributes, unmodified, the same official releases the launcher downloads (each checked against the SHA-256 in `launcher/src/toolchain.cpp`) plus the SDL3 development package used by `tools/fetch_sdl.py`:
- **nodtool 1.4.4:** MIT License or Apache License 2.0.
- **Python 3.12.10 (embeddable):** Python Software Foundation License.
- **CMake 4.4.3:** BSD 3-Clause License (its HTML manual is left out).
- **Ninja 1.13.2:** Apache License 2.0.
- **SDL 3.4.16 (MinGW development package):** zlib License.
- **MinGW-w64 distro 20.0 by nuwen.net (Stephan T. Lavavej):** only its compiler part is kept: GCC 15.2.0 and binutils 2.45.1 (**GPL-3.0**, GCC runtime libraries under the **GCC Runtime Library Exception 3.1**), GMP 6.3.0, MPFR 4.2.2 and MPC 1.3.1 built into GCC (**LGPL-3.0**), ISL 0.24 (**MIT**) and the MinGW-w64 11.0.1 runtime (permissive licences). The distro's other programs and libraries are removed.
- **Corresponding source:** published with every release that carries the pack, as `wiipartyrecomp-sources.zip`: the official, unmodified source releases of GCC, binutils, GMP, MPFR, MPC, ISL and MinGW-w64 at those versions, and the distro's build scripts (`scripts-20.0`, which also stay inside the pack). The pack's `OFFLINE-PACK.txt` lists every file with its origin and SHA-256.

## Ingestion Pipeline Requirements
Before any external file or code snippet is introduced into this repository, the following five criteria must be strictly fulfilled and appended to this registry:

1. **Granular Path Mapping:** Specify the exact files reused, their upstream repository paths, and the precise commit hash or version snapshot.
2. **Copyright Maintenance:** Retain all original author credits and copyright lines entirely untouched within the source file headers.
3. **Licensing Isolation:** Record the exact license governing each specific file.
4. **Dependency Auditing:** Perform a deep-dependency check ensuring zero licensing incompatibilities exist with GPL-3.0-or-later.
5. **Structural Isolation:** Place all ingested code within dedicated directories, keeping them architecturally apart from the core project code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a file's provenance, author origin, or license conditions are ambiguous or unverified, **the code must not be copied**.

---

## Prohibited Material
The following materials are strictly prohibited from entering this repository under any circumstances:
- Code originating from `InputEvelution/wp` without signed, verifiable owner authorization.
- Development leaks, proprietary platform SDK components, or unverified source code.
- Original Wii Party game resources (`main.dol`, `.rel` modules, ISO dumps, textures, models, audio).

*Note: The local paths `games/wiiparty/disc/`, `games/wiiparty/extracted/`, and `reference/` must remain permanently enforced in `.gitignore` [3].*
